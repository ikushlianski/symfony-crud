# symfony-crud

Followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ZedKnWX9E">great tutorial</a> by Brad Traversy to get the basics of Symfony. Decided to begin with version 4 right away, since it's faster.

In this small app we create a CRUD system allowing us to create, update, delete and edit articles. This uses Twig templating engine.
